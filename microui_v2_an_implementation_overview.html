<h2 id="introduction" class="section_header">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This write-up outlines some of the implementation details of the
  <a class="link" href="https://github.com/rxi/microui">microui</a> library. At the time of writing this
  microui is <a class="link" href="https://github.com/rxi/microui/tree/9d61da3">version 2.01</a>
</p>

<p>
  Microui is a <em>tiny</em> <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1qyvQsjK5Y">immediate mode</a> UI library written in portable ANSI C — the library itself
  doesn&#39;t do any drawing but instead takes user input events (eg. mouse clicks
  and key presses), processes the UI and generates an iterable list of draw
  commands (eg. &quot;draw rectangle&quot;, &quot;draw text&quot;). The library&#39;s goals are as
  follows:
</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li class="list_item">small (<code>~1110 sloc</code>) </li>
  <li class="list_item">simply implemented </li>
  <li class="list_item">easy to use </li>
  <li class="list_item">easy to extend with custom controls </li>
  <li class="list_item">operating within a fixed memory region (never calls <code>malloc</code> or friends) </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Due to these goals, some of the choices made during its implementation differ
  from other immediate mode libraries, and thus the project might be less useful
  for certain scenarios. Generally the library is a good choice if:
</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li class="list_item">you want something small without too many built-in controls
         besides the basics, eg. you don&#39;t need a color picker </li>
  <li class="list_item">you&#39;re planning to use a lot of custom controls or are aiming for a
         specific visual style and are happy to implement your own custom
         controls </li>
  <li class="list_item">you&#39;re targeting a less-common platform which uses non-standard or
         custom-written rendering, eg. MS-DOS </li>
  <li class="list_item">you&#39;re targeting a platform where heap allocations might cause
         an issue, eg. a long running process on an embedded device </li>
  <li class="list_item">you want something lightweight to use as a base for a heavier
         UI library </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="windows_and_controls" class="section_header">Windows And Controls</h2>
<p>
  At the beginning of each frame microui takes user input — this is done by
  passing input events to the <code>mu_input...</code> functions. After handling input
  <code>mu_begin</code> is called and the UI itself is processed, all controls must exist
  within a window, thus the <code>mu_begin_window</code> function must be the next thing
  called.
</p>

<p>
  Microui uses a number of stacks internally:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li class="list_item"><code>container_stack</code>: stack of all current containers (windows and panels) </li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>clip_stack</code>: current &quot;clipping&quot; rectangle — when a clipping rectangle is pushed it is intersected with the last rectangle on this stack </li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>id_stack</code>: when a control id is generated (<code>mu_get_id</code>) the id at the top of this stack is used as its initial hash. An id in microui is a 32bit unsigned integer </li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>layout_stack</code>: the current state of the UI layout, eg. where the next control should be placed, current indentation level, dimensions of the current layout region </li>
</ul>

<p>
  When we call <code>mu_begin_window</code> an id is generated from the window title, the
  <code>mu_Container</code> for that window is pushed to the <code>container_stack</code>, the generated
  id is pushed to the <code>id_stack</code>, and a new <code>mu_Layout</code> is initialised to the size
  of the windows body and pushed to the <code>layout_stack</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Processing a button in the UI using <code>mu_button</code>, the function would first
  advance the layout system to get a rectangle representing where it will be
  placed (<code>mu_layout_next</code>), generate a unique id from the buttons name
  (<code>mu_get_id</code>), and update the <code>focus</code> and <code>hover</code> ids of the context based on
  the mouse state, window states and currently-clipped region
  (<code>mu_update_control</code>) before finally handling any control-specific behaviour and
  pushing draw commands.
</p>


<h2 id="hover_state" class="section_header">Hover State</h2>
<p>
  To determine whether a control is currently being hovered over by the user we
  first check to make sure the control&#39;s rectangle overlaps the mouse position, we
  then iterate down from the top of the <code>container_stack</code> to find the
  root-container we&#39;re currently in (that is, a container which is a window rather
  than a panel) and make sure that the root container matches the context&#39;s
  <code>hover_root</code> pointer, indicating that it is the root-container which the mouse
  is currently over; this is done such that a window above the button will prevent
  that button from being considered &quot;hovered&quot; over.
</p>

<p>
  As the windows aren&#39;t necessarily processed in the order they will eventually
  appear, the <code>hover_root</code> value is set each frame: the current frame uses the
  previous frame&#39;s hovered-over-window and thus always lags one frame behind. In
  practise this is effectively unnoticeable.
</p>

<p>
  This has to be done as we won&#39;t know the state of all the windows
  until the frame is finished, in fact we won&#39;t even know which windows <em>exist</em>
  until we&#39;ve finished processing the UI for a given frame.
</p>


<h2 id="z_ordering_in_a_fixed_sized_buffer" class="section_header">Z-ordering In A Fixed-Sized Buffer</h2>
<p>
  As microui uses a fixed sized region of memory, a <em>single</em> command list, and
  allows the windows to be processed in any order regardless of their z-order, a
  unique approach is taken to assure that when the user iterates the draw
  commands in the command list, that they are in bottom-to-top order.
</p>

<p>
  Each time <code>mu_window_begin</code> is called a pointer to the current position in the
  command list is stored by the window, and a &quot;jump&quot; command is pushed to the
  command list with a NULL pointer. When <code>mu_window_end</code> is called another jump
  command is pushed to the command list with a NULL pointer; the initially pushed
  jump command&#39;s pointer is then set to the now-current position of the command
  list, that is, the position where all the window&#39;s commands end.
</p>

<p>
  At the end of the frame all the windows from that frame are sorted by their
  <code>zindex</code> and have the jump command&#39;s pointer set to the beginning of the
  window-above-it&#39;s commands. The first jump command in the command list is set to
  go to the lowest window and the top-most window&#39;s jump command is set to go to
  the end of the command list.
</p>

<p>
  Thus if we processed a frame as the following:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
begin_main_window
  do_some_ui_stuff
  begin_popup_window
    do_some_popup_ui_stuff
  end_popup_window
  do_some_ui_stuff
end_main_window
</pre>

<p>
  The resultant command list would exist in memory as the following blocks, with
  the jump commands and their destinations shown as the lines connecting the
  blocks:
</p>

<img src="assets/microuiv2_jumps.png">

<p>
  The jump commands are handled internally by microui inside the <code>mu_next_command</code>
  function, and are thus something the user doesn&#39;t need to worry about in normal
  usage.
</p>


<p>
  The approach of having a single command list for all windows allows us to have
  much simpler code as opposed to an approach where we would have a command list
  per-window. We only need to keep track of and manage a single buffer which
  everything is pushed to linearly vs having multiple buffers all of which would
  be partially filled with commands.
</p>

<p>
  An additional perk of the single command list is that at the end of the frame
  the command list itself can be hashed and compared with the previous frame&#39;s
  hash to see if anything on screen has actually changed. If nothing has changed
  then drawing can be skipped for that frame.
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
mu_get_id(ctx, &amp;ctx-&gt;command_list, sizeof(ctx-&gt;command_list))
</pre>


<h2 id="a_forgetful_ui" class="section_header">A Forgetful UI</h2>
<p>
  As with all immediate mode UI some state still needs to be retained — eg.
  scroll bars, content sizes, window position/sizes and tree-node states.
  Typically this is done by mapping the id for a given control or window to its
  state internally, this is what microui does.
</p>

<p>
  An issue arises then that given the nature of immediate mode UI we never know
  for sure if a control or window is no longer in use, thus how do we know when
  we&#39;d be able to free the state for that control or window?
</p>

<p>
  Microui employs the use of internal fixed-sized pools to store this state, and
  to solve the issue of knowing which state in the pool it can stop retaining
  employs a &quot;forgetful&quot; approach: for each piece of state (eg, a window&#39;s
  container) that&#39;s stored internally, a <code>last_updated</code> value is kept which
  represents the last frame in which the given window or control was processed in
  the UI. When we begin a window which has no state stored internally and we have
  no remaining slots in the pool, we simply find the least-recently-updated state
  and reinitialise this slot, claiming it for the current window.
</p>

<p>
  A disadvantage to this approach is that we have a hard limit on the amount of
  windows we can have active at the same time, or visible tree-nodes in a
  non-default position. Microui uses a pool of <code>48</code> window containers thus we can
  only display 48 windows or panels at a time, for context this is what 48 windows
  actually looks like:
</p>

<img src="assets/microuiv2_windows.png">

<p>
  In normal usage it&#39;s hard to imagine this being an issue, that being said the
  pool&#39;s upper limit can be trivially increased by changing a single constant in
  the code if needs be.
</p>

<p>
  The consequence of a piece of state being &quot;reclaimed&quot; is simply that that window
  or control is reset to its default value. In typical usage the reclaiming ends
  up effectively unnoticeable as generally transient popup windows or tree-node
  states which haven&#39;t been interacted with for a while are those reset to their
  default value if a lot of other activity has occurred in the time since. It&#39;s
  not hard to imagine that the UI would be less &quot;forgetful&quot; than a typical user,
  and thus the resetting of &quot;old&quot; state would go unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
  One additional perk of this approach is that because all state exists in fixed
  sized buffers we can store the current state of the UI to a binary file by
  simply dumping the memory of the state pools (along with the context&#39;s
  <code>last_zindex</code> and <code>frame</code>). When the application next starts this file can be
  loaded to restore the state of the UI.
