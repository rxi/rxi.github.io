<h2 id="overview" class="section_header">Overview</h2>
<p>
  This write-up details what could be considered a &quot;full set&quot; of standard core
  functionality for text input boxes in user interfaces for referential purposes
  during implementation.
</p>
<p>
  The core components of textbox behaviour are split into three parts:
  One we can call <strong>Movements</strong>, which describe a means of moving from
  one position to the next <em>(eg. one-character-to-the-left)</em>,
  <strong>Operations</strong> which use a movement to perform an action <em>(eg. select-to)</em>
  and finally <strong>Commmands</strong>, most of which will be an operation
  performing a movement, although they are not limited to this.
</p>

<h2 id="caret_and_selection" class="section_header">Caret and Selection</h2>
<p>
  The caret/selection of a textbox is typically implemented as a pair of
  integers; both are grouped together as they are part of the same thing. The
  first integer (we&#39;ll refer to this as the head) is the caret&#39;s current
  position; the second integer (the tail) is the other end of the selection —
  in the case that there is no text selected the head and tail are the same
  value and only the caret is displayed. In the case that there is text selected
  the value of both sides differ from one another.
</p>

<h2 id="operations" class="section_header">Operations</h2>
<p>
  Textboxes support the following 3 core operations for navigating and editing
  text; each operation uses a single movement to achieve it&#39;s goal — in terms
  of implementation you could think of each operation implemented as a function
  which itself takes a movement-function as an argument. As the movements are
  common between operations this reduces code duplication as each movement only
  needs to be implemented once to be used by any operation.
</p>
<p>
  The operations are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li class="list_item"><code>move-to</code> - Moves the position of the caret (both sides of the selection)</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>select-to</code> - Moves <em>only</em> the head of the selection and leaves the tail uneffected</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>delete-to</code> - Deletes everything between the caret and resultant position</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="single_line_movements" class="section_header">Single-line Movements</h2>
<p>
  Single line movements are supported by both single-line textboxes and
  multi-line text boxes. The core single-line movements are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li class="list_item"><code>left</code> - move one character to the left</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>right</code> - move one character to the right</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>next-word-end</code> - skip rightward whitespace and move to the end of the next word; if we&#39;re currently in the middle of a word move to the end of that word </li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>previous-word-end</code> - skip leftward whitespace and move to the start of the previous word; if we&#39;re currently in the middle of a word move to the start of that word </li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>start</code> - move to before the first character of the text</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>end</code> - move to after the last character of the text</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If by performing a movement it would result in the position being before
  the start of the text or after the end of the text, the result should be
  clamped to the text&#39;s bounds.
</p>


<h2 id="multi_line_movements" class="section_header">Multi-line Movements</h2>
<p>
  Multi-line movements are supported only by multi-line text boxes; these are as
  follows:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li class="list_item"><code>up</code> - move to the line above</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>down</code> - move to the line below</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>line-start</code> - move to the start of the current line (the soft-line if word-wrapped)</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>line-end</code> - move to the end of the current line (the soft-line if word-wrapped)</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>page-up</code> - move up by the height of the textbox</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>page-down</code> - move down by the height of the textbox</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In the case of several successive vertical movements the horizontal position
  should always be as close to the initial horizontal position from the first
  movement. Vertical movement horizontal positioning should be performed to keep
  <em>visual</em> consistency rather than character-offset consistency, eg.
  moving up a line should place the caret as close as possible on the screen to
  its original horizontal position.
</p>
<p>
  In the case of <code>page-up</code> and <code>page-down</code> the caret should move the
  distance of the textbox&#39;s height. A page-up movement followed by a page-down
  movement should always result in returning to the original position, with the
  exception of the case where the page-up movement places the caret at the
  beginning of the text as there is not a whole textbox-height space above the
  current position.
</p>

<h2 id="movement_based_commands" class="section_header">Movement-based Commands</h2>
<p>
  By combining the operations and movements described above, the following core
  commands can be supported:
</p>
<ul class="list">
   <li class="list_item"><code>backspace</code> - delete-to + left - <em>(Backspace, Shift+Backspace)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>delete</code> - delete-to + right - <em>(Delete)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>delete-word-left</code> - delete-to + word-left - <em>(Ctrl+Backspace, Ctrl+Shift+Backspace)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>delete-word-right</code> - delete-to + word-right - <em>(Ctrl+Delete)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>move-left</code> - move-to + left - <em>(Left)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>move-right</code> - move-to + right - <em>(Right)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>move-up</code> - move-to + up - <em>(Up)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>move-down</code> - move-to + down - <em>(Down)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>move-word-left</code> - move-to + word-left - <em>(Ctrl+Left)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>move-word-right</code> - move-to + word-right - <em>(Ctrl+Right)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>move-line-start</code> - move-to + line-start - <em>(Home)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>move-line-end</code> - move-to + line-end - <em>(End)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>move-start</code> - move-to + start - <em>(Ctrl+Home)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>move-end</code> - move-to + end - <em>(Ctrl+End)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>select-left</code> - select-to + left - <em>(Shift+Left)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>select-right</code> - select-to + right - <em>(Shift+Right)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>select-up</code> - select-to + up - <em>(Shift+Up)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>select-down</code> - select-to + down - <em>(Shift+Down)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>select-word-left</code> - select-to + word-left - <em>(Ctrl+Shift+Left)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>select-word-right</code> - select-to + word-right - <em>(Ctrl+Shift+Right)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>select-line-start</code> - select-to + line-start - <em>(Shift+Home)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>select-line-end</code> - select-to + line-end - <em>(Shift+End)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>select-start</code> - select-to + start - <em>(Ctrl+Shift+Home)</em></li>
   <li class="list_item"><code>select-end</code> - select-to + end - <em>(Ctrl+Shift+End)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Both the <code>move-left</code> and <code>move-right</code> commands have a special case:
  if there is text selected, instead of performing the usual operation
  of moving one character to the left/right, the caret is instead moved to the
  corresponding edge of the selected text and the selection is canceled.
</p>

<h2 id="additional_commands" class="section_header">Additional Commands</h2>
<p>
  In addition to the movement based commands there are several other commands
  which do not rely on movement:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li class="list_item"><code>newline</code> - inserts a new line in a multi-line textbox - <em>(Return, Shift+Return)</em></li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>select-all</code> - selects all text in the textbox - <em>(Ctrl+A)</em></li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>cut</code> - copies the current selection to the clipboard and deletes it - <em>(Ctrl+X, Shift+Delete)</em></li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>copy</code> - copies the current selection to the clipboard - <em>(Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Insert)</em></li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>paste</code> - inserts the text currently on the clipboard - <em>(Ctrl+V, Shift+Insert)</em></li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>undo</code> - undoes up to the last point of 300ms of inaction - <em>(Ctrl+Z)</em></li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>redo</code> - negates a previously performed undo command - <em>(Ctrl+Y)</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mouse_input" class="section_header">Mouse Input</h2>
<p>
  Textboxes typically support mouse input for modifying the selection. There are
  3 modes to mouse input, the state of which is determined by the number of
  clicks that occurred:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li class="list_item"><code>single-click</code> - character-granularity</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>double-click</code> - word-granularity</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>triple-click</code> - line-granularity</li>
</ul>
<p>
  When the mouse is pressed down the both sides of the selection are
  set to the current mouse cursor position. If the mouse is then dragged the
  head of the selection is moved to that position while the tail remains in
  place of the original click. If <em>Shift</em> is held when the mouse is
  clicked the tail of the selection is uneffected and only the head is changed.
</p>
<p>
  The placement of both sides of the selection are based around the
  granularities specified above, such that, for example, if one were to double
  click and drag their mouse it would select a word at a time; if one were
  to triple-click it would select a line at a time.
