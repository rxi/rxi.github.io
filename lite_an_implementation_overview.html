<h2 id='introduction' class='section-header'>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This write-up outlines some of the implementation details of the
  <a class='link' href='http://github.com/rxi/lite'> lite</a> text editor. At the time of writing
  this lite is version <a class='link' href='https://github.com/rxi/lite/releases/tag/v1.06'>
  1.06</a>.
</p>

<h2 id='overview' class='section-header'>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Lite is written mainly in Lua (5.2) with the lowest level parts written in C.
  It is written with the intent of being lightweight, easy on the eyes,
  responsive and trivial to modify and extend. To achieve this the core
  implementation aims to be <em>as simple as possible</em>: complexity is only
  brought in when it&#39;s proven the simplest method isn&#39;t practical.
</p>


<h2 id='core' class='section-header'>Core</h2>
<p>
  The core of lite implements documents, syntax highlighting, a
  cooperative-threading system, basic logging and the general ui layout system.
  Overall the core is in charge of handling user input, running per-frame tasks,
  and rendering the resultant frame early enough to meet the frames-per-second
  specified in <code>config.fps</code>.
</p>


<h2 id='threads' class='section-header'>Threads</h2>
<p>
  Lite implements a cooperative-threading system where by background tasks —
  such as full-document syntax highlighting and updating the internal list of
  project files — can be performed incrementally. Cooperative threads in lite are
  implemented using lua&#39;s coroutines and are referred internally as simply
  <code>threads</code>.
</p>
<p>
  A thread can be started by using the <code>core.add_thread()</code> function, this
  function takes a function, and an optional object which is used as a weak
  reference to that thread, eg. if a doc is passed as the weak reference, when
  that doc is garbage collected the coinciding thread will also cease to exist.
</p>
<p>
  As threads in lite are cooperative they&#39;re expected to regularly call
  <code>couroutine.yield()</code>. Typically this yielding is done every <code>n</code>
  lines for line-based tasks (eg. full-project search, syntax highlighting).
  When a thread yields the core will continue to render the frame, or — if there is
  still enough time left in the current frame — pass control to another thread.
  Threads can also pass a numerical argument to <code>coroutine.yield()</code> to wait
  for the number of seconds specified:
</p>
<pre class='codeblock'>
core.add_thread(function()
  -- print &quot;hello world&quot; every 10 seconds
  while true do
    print(&quot;hello world&quot;)
    coroutine.yield(10)
  end
end
</pre>
<p>
  Practical usage examples of lite&#39;s threading can be seen in the core&#39;s project
  file scanning (<code>core/init.lua</code>) and the incremental syntax highlighting
  (<code>core/doc/highlighter.lua</code>).
</p>

<h2 id='documents' class='section-header'>Documents</h2>
<p>
  All loaded text files in lite are stored in <code>Docs</code>. A doc keeps a table
  of a text file&#39;s lines (<code>Doc.lines</code>), undo and redo
  state, the current syntax (<code>Doc.syntax</code>), syntax highlighting state
  (<code>Doc.highlighter</code>) and caret/selection state. Docs are opened using the
  <code>core.open_doc()</code> function; if the function is called and a doc of that
  filename is already open then the existing doc is returned such that
  more-than-one doc representing the same file should never be present.
</p>
<p>
  Lite stores all the open docs in the <code>core.docs</code> table; each frame lite
  checks the number of views referencing each doc and releases those with zero
  references — this is an instance of lite favoring polling over callbacks or
  event listeners. This approach is done throughout lite; in avoiding event
  listeners we also avoid having to manage unregistering event handlers or worry
  about having those which are never unregistered through error. This leads to
  much simpler, less error-prone code.
</p>
<h2 id='syntax_highlighting' class='section-header'>Syntax Highlighting</h2>
<p>
  Lite implements a simple syntax highlighter based around lua patterns, this is
  split up into 3 parts:
</p>
<ul class='list'>
  <li class='list-item'><code>core.syntax</code>: stores language syntax specifications</li>
  <li class='list-item'><code>core.tokenizer</code>: converts text into table of tokens using a given syntax</li>
  <li class='list-item'><code>core.doc.highlighter</code>: stores token state for lines of a doc and handles
         full-document incremental highlighting</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A language syntax is stored as a table of lua patterns mapped to to their
  resultant token type (<code>.patterns</code>) and a table of symbols mapped to their
  token type (<code>.symbols</code>). Patterns in the pattern table can also be a
  range of the following format:
</p>
<pre class='codeblock'>
{ range_start_pattern, range_end_pattern [, escape_character] }
</pre>
<p>
  Ranges can be used for matching strings:
</p>
<pre class='codeblock'>
{ &#39;&quot;&#39;, &#39;&quot;&#39;, &#39;\\&#39; }
</pre>
<p>
  An example of syntax specifications can be seen in any of the
  <code>data/plugins/language_*.lua</code> files.
</p>
<p>
  The highlighter persists range state between lines by storing the pattern
  table index of the current range. As the highlighter works in increments of
  lines, ranges are useful for multi-line comments or strings which a single
  pattern would fail on.
</p>
<p>
  When the <code>tokenizer.tokenize()</code> function is called it iterates the syntax&#39;s
  pattern table from top to bottom, such that patterns higher up in the table
  take precedence. When it matches a pattern it pushes the token to the
  resultant table, if the token&#39;s content matches any of the keys in the
  <code>.symbols</code> table that value is used instead of the matched token value;
  this acts both as a more convenient way of specifying keywords as well as an
  optimization as the tokenizer can attempt matching fewer patterns, even if
  there are many keywords specified. The function returns a <code>state</code> integer
  which is used to indicate which pattern range it is currently inside if it is
  inside any.
</p>
<p>
  <code>core.doc.highlighter</code> is in charge of providing tokenized lines when
  displaying a document; each doc stores a <code>Highlighter</code> object. The
  highlighter assures highlighting information for any line that is requested
  is <em>always</em> available, even if the full-document incremental highlighter
  has not yet reached that line.
</p>
<p>
  When a request is made to the highlighter for a specific line the highlighter
  first checks its cache for the line; if it does not have the line cached —
  or, if the line&#39;s text has changed since its cached version — it immediately
  tokenizes the line, continuing from the tokenizer state left from the
  previous line. The highlighter&#39;s <code>max_wanted_line</code> field is set to
  that line&#39;s value if it&#39;s greater than the existing <code>max_wanted_line</code>.
</p>
<p>
  A doc&#39;s highlighter creates a thread when it&#39;s created which it uses to do
  full-document highlighting starting from its <code>first_invalid_line</code> up
  until the <code>max_wanted_line</code>. When a change occurs in a document the
  <code>first_invalid_line</code> is set to the first line of the change if it&#39;s
  greater than the current <code>first_invalid_line</code>.
</p>
<p>
  This implementation results in the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul class='list'>
  <li class='list-item'>Displayed lines are always syntax highlighted with, at the very
         least, highlighting which is valid to the current screen&#39;s content</li>
  <li class='list-item'>Displayed lines are <em>eventually</em> highlighted with
         full-document aware highlighting</li>
  <li class='list-item'>The highlighting is performed per-line, and so — with the exception
         of extremely long lines — can be done incrementally without a
         negative effect on responsiveness</li>
  <li class='list-item'>Highlighting is only performed up until the point in the document it
         is required, for example, up until the last visible line</li>
</ul>


<h2 id='user_interface' class='section-header'>User Interface</h2>
<p>
  Each part of lite&#39;s UI is implemented as a <code>View</code>, that is, a document is
  shown in the UI as a <code>DocView</code>, the status bar at the bottom the
  <code>StatusView</code> etc. Each view exists within the <code>RootView</code>
  (<code>core.root_view</code>) which is in charge of calling the <code>:update()</code> and
  <code>:draw()</code> functions of each view, managing the layout of the
  views, and routing user input to relevant views.
</p>
<p>
  The rootview is implemented as a binary tree of <code>Nodes</code>. Each node is one
  of the following types:
</p>
<ul class='list'>
  <li class='list-item'><code>hsplit</code>: Contains two children side-by-side and a divider between them</li>
  <li class='list-item'><code>vsplit</code>: Contains two children one-above-the-other and a divider between them</li>
  <li class='list-item'><code>leaf</code>: Contains one or more views, and, if there is more than one
        view, a tab at the top for each view.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each frame the rootview calculates its layout based on the divider position of
  each split and sets the <code>.size</code> field of each node and view accordingly.
</p>
<p>
  The rootview also has a concept of <em>locked nodes</em>; the size of a locked
  node is not determined by the divider position but instead is set from the
  view&#39;s <code>.size</code> field. Locked nodes cannot be resized by the user as
  normal nodes would be, they cannot be closed and cannot open additional views.
  The locked-node feature is used for, amongst other things, the status bar at the
  bottom of the screen which we typically want to be always present and
  immutable.
</p>
<p>
  lite takes the approach of effectively redrawing <em>everything</em> whenever
  it needs to redraw <em>anything</em>, this lends itself to simplified UI code.
  There are no event listeners or callbacks to manage. If something changes the
  state of the UI (eg. the caret is moved), the <code>core.redraw</code> boolean is set
  to <code>true</code> to signify that something has changed and the UI is redrawn on
  that frame. For further simplicity any user input events will also set
  <code>core.redraw</code>, such that there&#39;s a guarantee any change which resulted from
  user input will result in the screen contents being updated.
</p>
<p>
  Although the idea of redrawing everything each time may appear wasteful, lite
  employs a technique where by only regions of the screen which have changed
  between frames are actually redrawn — these regions can be displayed by calling
  <code>renderer.show_debug(true)</code>. This technique is implemented on the C level
  of the code and is invisible to the lua portion which acts as if it&#39;s doing
  a full redraw each time.
</p>
<p>
  An overview of how this is achieved is detailed in the
  <a class='link' href='cached_software_rendering.html'> Cached Software Rendering</a> write-up.
</p>


<h2 id='plugins' class='section-header'>Plugins</h2>
<p>
  Lite&#39;s plugin system is based around lua&#39;s module system; each plugin is
  simply a lua module (that is, a single <code>.lua</code> file, or, a directory
  containing a <code>init.lua</code> file). All modules in the <code>data/plugins</code>
  directory are automatically loaded when lite starts — this is done after
  initializing the core and before loading the user and project modules. Thus to
  install a plugin you simply place the file in the plugins directory; to
  uninstall a plugin you delete the file.
</p>
<p>
  A specific order of which plugins are loaded is not guaranteed by lite but,
  as plugins are just regular lua modules, a plugin can simply call <code>require</code>
  on another plugin if it needs to assure that plugin is loaded before it, or
  depends on functionality from that plugin.
</p>
<p>
  The lua which plugins are made from and the that which lite is made from are
  no different, effectively giving plugins the ability to modify lite in almost
  any way the user sees fit. Instead of implementing an event listener system
  which would both litter the implementation with code to emit events, as well
  as limit the places lite can be modified to those which emit these events,
  lite instead encourages plugins to simply override existing functions
  directly. For example, if we wanted a plugin to run our <code>build.sh</code> script
  each time a document is saved it could be implemented as such:
</p>
<pre class='codeblock'>
local Doc = require &quot;core.doc&quot;

local save = Doc.save
function Doc:save(...)
  save(self, ...)
  system.exec(&quot;./build.sh&quot;)
end
</pre>
<p>
  Plugins are free to override drawing functions (for drawing lines under
  words), keymap handling (to implement modal editing), create their own views
  (for project-wide text search) or any other part of lite.
</p>
<p>
  A plugin is never expected to be able to unload itself, instead assuming that
  lite is restarted for cases where the user wants to remove or add a plugin.
  No care has to be taken to properly keep track of what changes a given
  plugin has made as those changes will never need to be undone.
</p>
