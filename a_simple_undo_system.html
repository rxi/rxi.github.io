<h2 id="overview" class="section_header">Overview</h2>
<p>
  This write-up describes a simple, practical implementation of an undo system
  for tools and applications. Although this technique is not applicable to all
  software, for cases where it is (such as small tools), it can be applied
  trivially with very little change to the existing code and overall project
  structure.
</p>
<p>
  The undo system is based around calling a single function before potentially
  modifying any block of data. At the end of the user interaction a &quot;commit&quot;
  function is called which checks each block of data for differences with its
  pre-commit state and pushes the old data to the undo stack for any of these
  differences.
</p>
<p>
  As the system works by marking data which <em>may</em> change before
  it <em>has</em> changed, the approach lends itself well to immediate mode UIs
  where there may be no indicator that a value will change before it does, nor a
  convenient way of retrieving its previous value after it has changed.
</p>

<h2 id="usage" class="section_header">Usage</h2>
<p>
  The main loop of a simple program which edits the content of a small bitmap
  may look as follows:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
for (;;) {
  handle_events();

  if (mouse.is_pressed) {
    set_pixel(bitmap, mouse.x, mouse.y);
  }

  draw();
}
</pre>
<p>
  Undo/redo support could then be added with the simple addition of two lines of
  code:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
for (;;) {
  handle_events();

  if (mouse.is_pressed) {
    undo_push(bitmap, sizeof(bitmap))
    set_pixel(bitmap, mouse.x, mouse.y);
  }

  if (!mouse.is_pressed) { undo_commit(); }

  draw();
}
</pre>
<p>
  Any change made to the bitmap would then be tracked by the undo system, calls
  to the undo system&#39;s <code>undo_undo()</code> and <code>undo_redo()</code> functions
  would undo and redo the user&#39;s actions as expected.
</p>
<p>
  Several blocks of memory can be passed to the undo system by calling
  <code>undo_push()</code> on each block which may change. In a situation where our
  bitmap is large it may be more practical to call <code>undo_push()</code> on each
  <em>region</em> of potential-change as opposed to the entire bitmap. This
  reduces the amount of work the undo system has to do in detecting changes:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
void set_pixel(unsigned *bitmap, int x, int y) {
  unsigned *p = &amp;bitmap[x + y * WIDTH];
  undo_push(p, sizeof(*p));
  *p = 0xff00ff;
}
</pre>
<p>
  Alternatively the region could be an entire pixel-row instead of a single
  pixel, or several rows, depending on the operation being performed.
</p>
<p>
  Note that in all cases only the <em>changes</em> are pushed to the resultant
  undo stack after <code>undo_commit()</code> is called. The block of data passed to
  <code>undo_push()</code> is kept only until <code>undo_commit()</code> is called.
</p>
<p>
  The application of this approach to undo isn&#39;t limited to bitmaps. For
  example, if you have a fixed buffer of game-objects, commands or other items,
  the fixed buffers could be passed to <code>undo_push()</code>, or — if the buffers
  are large — individual items in the buffers could be passed before changes
  are made to those items:
</p>
<pre class="codeblock">
undo_push(object, sizeof(*object));
object-&gt;x = 10;
object-&gt;y = 20;
</pre>


<h2 id="implementation" class="section_header">Implementation</h2>
<p>
  Internally the implementation stores 3 stacks:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li class="list_item"><code>undo</code> — Stores changes that can be undone</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>redo</code> — Stores undone changes which can be redone</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>temp</code> — Stores copies of all blocks of data
         passed to <code>undo_push</code> since the last commit</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each stack stores a series of <code>items</code> — a single <code>item</code> consists
  of the following parts which are pushed to the stack in order (and thus popped
  from the stack in the reverse order):
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li class="list_item"><code>data</code> — Copy of the data before it was modified</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>pointer</code> — Pointer to the data&#39;s location in memory</li>
  <li class="list_item"><code>size</code> — Size in bytes of the data</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The <code>undo_push()</code> function takes a pointer and size value. When it is
  called the <code>temp stack</code> is first scanned to check if we already have an
  item for the given data block — if so the function already has
  the old-data for this commit and can return without doing anything. Otherwise
  — if the data is not on the <code>temp stack</code> — we push an item for the
  given pointer and size: pushing the data at the pointer, the pointer itself
  and finally the size of the data block.
</p>
<p>
  When <code>undo_commit()</code> is called each item is popped from the <code>temp stack</code>
  and the stored data is compared to the current data at the item&#39;s pointer. Any
  differences are pushed as items to the <code>undo stack</code>. When the first
  change is encountered the <code>redo stack</code> is reset and a null item is
  pushed to the <code>undo stack</code> — this item is used to indicate the
  beginning of this commit.
</p>
<p>
  When <code>undo_undo()</code> is called each item on the <code>undo stack</code> is popped
  until the null item is reached. The data stored for each item is pushed to
  the <code>redo stack</code> so that it can be redone and the item&#39;s data is copied
  to the location of the item&#39;s stored pointer such as to restore its old state.
</p>
<p>
  The implementation of <code>undo_redo()</code> is identical to that of
  <code>undo_undo()</code> but with the roles of the undo and redo
  stacks swapped.
</p>
<p>
  To deal with running out of memory on the <code>undo stack</code> the stack&#39;s push
  operation can be implemented such that the content at the beginning of the
  stack is discarded by shifting the entire stack&#39;s content if it does not have
  enough space for the pushed item. In <code>undo_undo()</code> a scan of the
  <code>undo stack</code> can be performed to check for the existence of a null item
  as to ensure a full commit exists before the undo operation is attempted.
